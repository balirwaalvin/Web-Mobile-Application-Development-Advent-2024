//The Role of an IDE in JavaScript Programming
//An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a powerful toolbox designed to make coding more efficient. 
//An IDE offers a range of features that streamline the development process. As shown below;

//1. CODE EDITING:
    //Syntax Highlighting - IDEs color-code your code based on syntax, making it much easier to read and understand. 
    //Autocompletion - As you type, IDEs suggest code completions, saving you time and reducing errors.
    // This is especially helpful for remembering function names, object properties, and more programming features.
   //Code Formatting - IDEs can automatically format your code according to best practices, ensuring consistency and readability.

//2. DEBUGGING:

   //Breakpoints - IDEs let you pause code execution at specific points to inspect variables, step through code line by line, and identify the source of errors.
   //Variable Inspection - You can easily examine the values of variables at different stages of your program's execution,helping you understand how your code is behaving.
   //Error Highlighting - IDEs often highlight errors directly in your code as you type, providing immediate feedback and helping you fix issues early on.

//Popular JavaScript IDEs:
