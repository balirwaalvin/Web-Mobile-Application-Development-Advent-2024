//VARIABLES - Variables are like containers for storing data or values that can be modified during the execution of a program 
//however Constants have their values intended to remain unchanged throughout the program's execution. 
//Once you assign a value to a constant, you cannot reassign or revamp it either way unlike variables.

//DECLARATION
//Variables have a traditional way of declaring them which is; 
//"var" and "let"
//Constants on the other hand are declared by the "const" keyword

//EXAMPLE USAGE (VARIABLES)

let Number = 78; 
// Value of 'Number' is updated to 30
Number = 90; 
console.log(Number);

//EXAMPLE USAGE (CONSTANTS)

//const PIE = 456;
// This will throw an error if activated above
PIE = 356;  
console.log(PIE);
